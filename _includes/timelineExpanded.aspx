        <h2 class="timeline_modals">FarmSource program developed</h2>
        <p class="timeline_modals">The introduction of our FarmSource program in 2002 pioneered the creation of the infrastructure needed to get local products into the hands of our suppliers and onto the plates of our guests. Through FarmSource, we work with more than 120 local farmers and producers, all within a 125-mile radius of our units. In fact, we have been recognized by the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture (PASA) for our ongoing support of local agriculture through FarmSource.   This program greatly reduces the distance food travels from harvest to table. This decreases air pollution, water pollution, traffic congestion and the need for oil.</p>
        <p class="timeline_modals">Because of FarmSource, our guests enjoy fresh, wholesome foods, including:</p>
        <ul class="timeline_modals">
            <li>Produce that is selected through farmer-based organizations</li>
            <li>Dairy products that come from independently owned and operated local farm families that choose not to treat their herds with rBGH/rBST</li>
            <li>Meat that is produced at USDA-inspected facilities, which source their animals from farms that are within the region and ensure high standards of animal care, well-being and nutrition</li>
            <li>Products from local artisans who devote their time, energy and passion to a limited line of products and emphasize high quality and unique flavors</li>

        <p class="timeline_modals">We only purchase fluid milk that comes from independently owned family farms that do not use rBST/rBGH to increase their cows’ milk production. We purchase from these dairies because we believe in preserving the natural milk supply for our locations.</p>
        <p class="timeline_modals">Recombinant bovine somatotropin hormone, sometimes referred as BGH, rBGH and BST, is a genetically engineered copy of a naturally occurring hormone produced by cows. The naturally occurring hormone regulates the amount of milk a cow can produce; the genetically engineered copy of the hormone is used specifically to boost those amounts, in turn producing more milk. According to the FDA, no significant difference has been shown and no test can distinguish between milk from rBGH-treated and untreated cows.</p>

        <p class="timeline_modals">From a handful of farms 15 years ago, the community-supported agriculture (CSA) concept has grown to as many as 5,000 nationwide.  People sign up for a CSA, pay a regular fee and receive a weekly box of farm goods, generally delivered somewhere in their own neighborhood.</p>
        <p class="timeline_modals">Parkhurst takes it one step further by creating opportunities for smaller farms to sell and deliver fresh produce to our clients’ associates and other guests - while Parkhurst chefs prepare and present recipe ideas using the fresh food harvested from the CSA farms. The farmer gets a dependable source of income and a dependable destination for the produce, and our clients receive fresh fruits and vegetables, far fresher than anything you can get at the store.</p>
